Need to refresh messages to show new ones, can't access any of my albums that are on an SD card. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but had yet another issue! When trying to log in to one of my accounts, Instagram kept saying in multiple ways that the account couldn't be found. Had to go through the process of recovering it, even though I was just using it before the reinstall."", ""I'd rate this higher if the app would open links using Chrome instead of a window that's internal to the app. If you want to go back to the app, you have to close the link. I know that I can click and open the link in Chrome AFTER the link has already loaded. That's an extra step, uses extra data...I could go on but you get the point. Fix this issue and give me a preference where I can choose how to open links and I will update my rating. Until then, you can continue losing as revenue from me."", ""Crashing since last update, no response from support. Tried to post a reel, now it gets approximately one third the way uploaded and crashes, the app closes. It restarts when I open it and does this everytime now. I get about 45 seconds before it crashes again. Have sent multiple messages , and nothing in response. Hopefully they address this issue as it seems to be a common complaint now, and fix it... looking forward to a new update."", ""Fix the reels feature. While creating a reel the app freezes, if i make more than 5 separate text additions in the reel I cannot scroll down to edit them further as they stack. It will not allow me to save a draft, and yesterday the reel I made disappeared altogether in the \""upload\"" process. Poof, gone. I'm trying to use ig to create a portfolio of my artwork and reels are no longer reliable. I've put it off but I think I'm better off making a tiktok."", ""App has been broken for months - I have \""save copy to phone gallery\"" disabled, yet Instagram always saves a copy to my phone no matter what. If I post multiple photos cropped for landscape, they are are distorted and post in portrait mode with very tall dimensions. The only way to fix this is to uninstall and reinstall - but even then, it only works for ONE post. I have to do it every time I want to post multiple photos. Awful, and still hasn't been fixed."", ""So my issue is the new update. I don't like that it automatically scrolls down to the next video, sometimes I'm still typing things and it's very distracting when all of a sudden I hear a new video. As someone with mental problems,please fix that. My other issue is, now it's not letting me interact with about 50% of videos I come across. I can not click on anything on some videos. Not even to mute it. This app is becoming more and more horrible with each update"", ""I have been experiencing errors left and right when trying to upload to my stories. it says \""error\"" all the time when I do and it only works at times. Not to mention everytime I go on the app it says \""Cannot refresh feed\"" leaving me on a blank screen to reload by swiping down. It's been pissing me off, I always have to re-do stories because they don't save or even go on my story because of an \""error\"" It's annoying."", ""it's been terrible for a while now. can't use add yours stickers, can't edit reels without it crashing or somehow reverting saved changes after being uploaded, etc. a lot of these problems seem to be having for years now since whenever i search for a solution, i'll find articles dating from back in 2020 or earlier. the shift to reels in general have been awful. it's frustrating to use this app if it's not just to scroll through the feed."", ""There are so many bugs, all the time. I keep running into the issue of my posts or reels not posting and getting an error message. The app constantly freezes as I'm trying to make reels. And, the Save Draft button doesn't work anymore, I have to back out and hope it saved. Sometimes it doesn't save and it gives me another error message. Very frustrating."", ""I enjoy photography and enhancing memories with just a few clicks. Wish the application offered more features. Like a music profile on our page,I understand they have a very visual HTML format, I feel like they could bog down some scrolling features. And definitely switch up the mutual or suggested friends could match better. Overall as far as PR and picture editing features it's A1"", ""This is a good app, but I don't like how you can't stop posted photos from being saved to your gallery anymore like you used to. I turned off the ability to save posted photos, but it still does it. Not to mention that whenever I select a profile from a user's following list & then exit the profile of a person they follow, it sometimes takes me back to the top & I have to scroll down again which can get annoying. Please fix."", ""I constantly have to uninstall and then reinstall just to post a picture because it will not allow me to zoom in on a picture. When you go to edit, all pictures are the original size and not the way it was edited to. Very frustrating!!! Instagram is made by FACEBOOK right? Why then is an app designed to show off photos more difficult and less user friendly than Facebook? Facebook allows you to add more photos after you post. Please fix the issues so it is more user friendly to post a picture!"", ""It's become absolutely awful. You take the time to find a song for a reel, you find the perfect song, you edit the video add effects and sounds. Then you spend some time to come up with the perfect title, youre done! You post the reel, 30 second later you get a notification \""you don't have permission to use this music from :: insert media company ::\"" Why is the song in available for me to choose on the first dang place!"", ""This has been my second least fave social app for a long time due to bugs. It's always difficult to post (bc editing will make pics have weird framing, so can only post never edit in app) Ever since I updated this year it's impossible for me to FIND my recently taken photos (I've searched in every album listed in IG). Not only that but it's like it randomly chooses what photos (including downloads) will even show up for me to post. It's infuriating and very frustrating. I wish I'd never updated"", ""Mostly ok. Lately the app has been loading wrong. My phone icons are layered in with the IG icons so I can't use the app properly. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but the issue continues. 1/14/24 edit - for the last two days, IG doesn't recognize the latest photos on my phone. Tried deleting and restarting the app. Nada. Tried turning the whole phone off/on. Still nada. Disappointed!"", ""I use this app all the time, but recently (within the last week) the app is no longer able to find the photos I have saved to my SD card. These photos are still available in my phone's gallery, I just can't post them to instagram because they don't show up in the gallery instragram creates from the photos on my device. I have tried clearing the app's cache, restarting my phone, making sure 'data saver' mode is off. Nothing fixes this. This review would be 5 stars if not for this issue."", ""Can't post camera photos to feed! Open app, click the plus sign to add photo(s), and nothing I've stored to my camera album shows up! The only way I can post from that album, is through the share option directly from the photo when I open it from the gallery first. This is fine for when I'm just wanting to post a single photo, but I can not share multiple photos to one post this way, so I'm stuck sharing camera pics one at time, one pic per post. The issue just started within the last few days!"", ""The \""save\"" menu that pops up is a great addition to let us choose which save folder to use, but it'd be nice if it were less prominent. It covers most of the screen, but if I want to quickly save a video and move on without picking a folder, it gets in the way. Maybe a smaller menu would be better. Removing a star because now anytime I take a screenshot it's \""dimmed\"" or really dark. This only happens with Instagram, no other apps."", ""Been trying to do a post just with horizontal, zoomed out pictures (3 to be precise), but the moment I go to the next page (effects) all the pictures have been changed to the vertical zoomed in format and after that I can't change them back anymore. The post just gets made with cropped, vertical zoomed in versions of the ones I wanted to do. Don't know how or when this gets fixed, but as a photographer and painter making a living out of this app, it is a total nightmare to post pictures. 0/10"", ""Came to see if I was the only one having issues logging in. Turns out I'm not! I was trying to switch from one account to another but I just get a blank screen whenever I try to open the app. Can't log in at all anymore! Edit: I posted this review ages ago, but most bug fixes have improved the app overall. Would love to be able to pause reels."", ""Within the last few week, I have not been able to upload video or reels. I've cleared the cache, restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it still won't allow me to post a reel. It tells me to try again, which I do, and it tells me that the upload failed. Articles online tell me to check my internet connection, which is fine. I've even turned off and re-enabled Wi-Fi. Logged in/out. I tried it all. I still can't upload any sort of video."", ""I've been using this app for years. Never in my life have I seen an app with this many bugs. First off, I can't even save pictures on insta I have to post them to my story to save them. Alot of my story archives just say December 31st, 1969. EDIT: Yall just took a feature away from me. I'm a public account. I'm so fed up. Edit 2: the issues still haven't been fixed. EDIT 3: I can't post on my story without the app closing, like I open the camera and it crashes. Another main feature I can't use."", ""The first review I did on insta's glitch problem was two years ago, and insta never fails to still have the same--and actually more--problems occurring. Insta should start fixing the fyp glitch; error in processing likes, comments, and saves; reels and highlights randomly not loading; etc. Please fix them... we know you're modifying the layout, but I don't even get notifications now..."", ""App is fine sometimes but has alot of problems. Currently wont let me open comments or like or shar videos. I can tap on them with a clean screen and all but it doesn't register. I cant make reels on the app anymore and have to upload them from a editing app. Audios will delete or freeze over and keep playing if i close the app or try to uplaod a new reel. Its annoying how bugs will get 'fixed' but then theres always new ones."", ""It always shows there's a message request in my inbox, when there's no message. To rectify this, I have to go in and delete ALL the messages in my inbox. Often I have to go back to conversations i had YEARS ago to fix it. Then it happens again out of nowhere Update: this is STILL an issue a year later Update 2: LET ME TURN OFF AUTO SCROLL OMG Update 3: I just installed it in a new phone and it freezes. Can't tap on anything, so i have to close the app and reopen it for it to work."", ""It's OK for the most part, but I've recently been experiencing a problem where eventually the app will only show comments from previous reels on new reels while scrolling. It also does this thing where it will only open the comments no matter where I touch my screen and won't let me like any videos. I cleared the catche on my phone, then deleted and reinstalled the app, but it's still not fixed. Idk why it's doing this but it's really annoying."", ""This app has truly taken a turn for the worse- and repeatedly. I wish we could make the chronological timeline that's composed of just people you follow the default (you know, how it used to be ages ago!). I also don't want to see suggested threads. I'm not interested in that app nor in seeing any of it's content. All of this mixed in with the insanely high number of ads just makes this app so incredibly unfriendly towards users and makes curating what you see near impossible."", ""If You're Wondering If It's your phone, it is not your phone.After the Android 14 Update for My S23, it keeps freezing up til you close the app,messages won't show up unless you close the app and go to the chat, back out, and back in again. And so many more issues with stability. Honestly, I'm going to switch over to a different platform to text people at this point."", ""This app enjoys gatekeeping its features from people, and it's how it sounds, only a specific amount of people will have said features for the app. I've been waiting two months for me to receive the feature of editing direct messages, even after unistalling 3 times. If they are still testing this feature, at least give the option in the settings to enable it, if it's any bothersome."", ""Instagram allowed logins from multiple devices from multiple countries on my account, yet when I try to log in to reset my password, I'm somehow the one that is being denied access at every corner. Error this, code expired that. They don't even have a button to press to contact support when they give you an email saying \""Your account is being accessed from all over the world, tough luck\"". If you value your privacy/ don't want random people easily getting into your account, skip Instagram."", ""Most recent up lost the apps ability to see my picture albums which are stored on a separate SD card. Can no longer post to my feed. Have almost 1600 posts to my feed with around 10k images posted. Had posted the day before the last update. A previous update last year lost access to my albums when posting add to yours in the stories. Kind of makes it hard for me to share my photos. 1.11.24. Tried uninstalling and reinstalled 3 times. No joy. It doesn't even see pictures I took earlier today."", ""This app is utterly destroyed. For months I have been experiencing random glitches, but recently it has gotten extremely bad. The feed is broken, I no longer get suggested content, I rarely ever get more than three posts before having to refresh to see old posts. My messages will vanish, not only the message, but now the actual chat itself. I have reinstalled the app to no avail. Instagram is part of the largest Social Network, it is a disappointment that they cant fix the bugs in their service."", ""Whenever i am watching reels (scrolling down liking whatever) its like the screen doesn't recognize me tapping on it. Its every other video. I cracked my phone screen a few months back so I thought it was the phone. Nope. I switched to my old phone and it does the same thing. It doesn't let me like, or tap comments on certain videos, I have to swipe out the app and other apps to go and he able to like it"", ""Instagram sucks, I can't schedule posts, when I've tried to contact support or get the problem fixed no response( I've tried multiple times) insta regularly deletes the captions on my reels, won't let me get rid of drafts except posting them and recently when editing a reel the audio disappeared, couldn't edit placement of text and if I clicked to change the words it made my phone buzz nonstop. I'm not going to mention algorithm much but I know it has not been the kindest to some including me."", ""When I try to share a note, it doesn't let me put music on the note, then when I try to view other people's notes, the song either isnt there, or it says \""song isnt available in your country \"". Then when I try to click the more info button, it just goes away. I tried restarting the app and the phone but it just doesn't go away. Please fix it Instagram!!!"", ""The latest updates have a bug where Android users are unable to access any media stored on the SD card. This is incredibly frustrating and makes using the app to upload anything of my own nearly impossible. This bug has been going on for two weeks and should have been fixed by now. They need to make it usable for everyone, regardless of device."", ""I've been using the app for years but recently my android device has a problem staying in dark mode completely after I exit and try to open the app again. The screen has pieces of the app that are white while it's in dark mode. Sometimes it causes the text boxes to turn white which leads to me not being able to read the white lettering very well. I use this app all the time I like it a lot it's just that dark mode that's getting annoying."", ""This app still needs alot of improvement. They will literally downgrade the quality of your videos on reels for no reason at all! Same with picture reels. They are not the same quality as just a regular post! Also randomly zooms in your photos just a lil bit, throwing all good angles off completely! It's not fair because you don't get what you posted. You get a slightly lesser quality, zoomed in picture that's now a different angle than what you posted!"", ""Is it only me or has it been so glitchy lately? Posts wouldn't load and appear blank no matter what wifi or connection I'm using. I've tried force stopping the app, reinstalling, refreshing, every other possible way to optimize the app. Also, what's up with the saved posts pages where only first 6 folders show up instead of all the other folders that I've created? I thought it was another glitch at first, but I'm still having the same problem. Please fix these problems asap for your next update."", ""The app is ok. The video chat feature sucks, it's super glitchy. Without fail, every time now when I try to call someone, it gives me the \""app having trouble, close app\"" notification on my phone because the app crashes. It won't work until I force stop the app, and this is now a daily occurrence. If I disconnect/reconnect to wifi, the video call will boot me off, and I will once again have to force stop the app.""]",com.instagram.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en&gl=us
