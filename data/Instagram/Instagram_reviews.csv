Can't post recents or pretty much anything taken from my SD card. App can now only post screenshots and random things stored locally on my phone. This has happened for a bit over a week now and I don't recommend because app it no longer works even across accounts and even after uninstalling and logging out and logging back in. Another problem I've been having is that messages don't appear for DAYS. TRY ANY OTHER APP BECAUSE THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.,1,7,313.0.0.26.328,2024-01-16 11:50:37,,,313.0.0.26.328
